CIFGlue
This is a simple rails app to make it easy to manually add indicators to a CIF server.  The application allows you to quickly and easily enter details about several indicators and save them to a database.  The CIF server can be instructed to pull from an RSS feed produced by the application.

Setup
Like most rails apps.  You're going to need to git clone this into a folder, then run bundle install to get all the gems.  I recommend using an RVM Gemset so that you can keep it all separate from other rails apps.  Update config/database.yml with your credentials.  Then run 'rake db:create' and you should be all set.  The app was built for a postgresql database but can be easily converted to use mysql or sqlite since I'm not using any postgres specific stuff in the database.

Since you might not work for Verizon you probably don't want your RSS feed to say Verizon intelligence and all that.  If you go into the app/models/settings.rb file you can change the ORGNAME value to something specific for your group.  The default value is Verizon so that you'll know who made this awesome app (which is basically a less-cool less-sophisticated version of Twitter).
